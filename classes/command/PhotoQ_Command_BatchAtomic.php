 * An atomic command can be queued in the batch processor for 
 * asynchronous processing. An atomic command is not split up 
 * over several Ajax invocations, it is either 0% completed if
 * it was never executed, or 100% completed if it was executed
 * once.
 * 
 * Subclass this class if you have small jobs that you want to 
 * run on the batch processor without having to manage the 
 * completion status yourself. Typically, you will want to group
 * several atomic commands in a batch macro command.
